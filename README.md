# Very Short Delay
"Very Short" is the delay for a very short period of time (0.5 msec - 50 msec). The feedback gain is between -0.98 and +0.98.

This type of delay works as "comb filter", which adds some metallic noise to the input source.

Runs on prologue, minilogue xd, NTS-1, NTS1 mkII, and drumlogue. (The source code for [drumlogue](https://github.com/boochow/veryshort/tree/drumlogue) and [NTS-1 mkII](https://github.com/boochow/veryshort/tree/nts1mkii) are on separate branches.)
